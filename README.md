# Simple-Turn-Based-Battle-Sym
My first attempt at a Pokemon-like turn based battle simulator using OPP C++.
The program if fairly modular and allows for more monsters/spells to be added pretty easily.

Issues/Potential Improvemts:
1. Monster AI for picking a move is very basic. It could be expanded to have different levels of intellegnce (similar to how pokemon does with its trainer AI).
2. Different spell types could be added such as damage boosting moves or damage over time.
3. Battle damage readouts are somewhat vauge when it comes to telling you which battler is making doing damage.
